<p>Matt Shane and Jim Holyoak made friends in 1999 in a drawing class at the University of Victoria. Since then, they have backpacked across Asia together, played in a band, lived together as roommates, and co-orchestrated numerous collaborative drawing projects, sometimes involving hundreds of people. Their work explores an ever-expanding ecology of creatures, monsters and ghost towns set amidst a forest of the mind. Their resultant immersive drawing installations amalgamate notions of studio, home, travel, and exhibition. Together, their work has been exhibited at the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, the GEM Museum in Den Haag, the Walter Phillips Gallery in Banff, Tegnerforbundet (Drawing Association) in Oslo, an enormous herring factory in Iceland, and a cabin in the woods outside Montréal. Shane currently teaches drawing and painting at NSCAD, while Holyoak is living out of a backpack and drawing monsters from observation.</p>
