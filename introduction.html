<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="byline">Breanna Fabro</p>

<p>Suzanne Simard, professor of forest ecology at the University of British Columbia, coined the term ‘Wood Wide Web’ to describe the underfoot systems of communication and exchange between trees and fungi; complex networks that are both macro in function and micro in appearance. Without fungi, mammoth old growth forests would never reach up, hundreds of feet towards the sky. Below the ground fungi and trees communicate, network, and feed, by way of miniscule eyelash-like tubes that allow the tree to absorb nutrients and minerals extracted from rocks by the fungi. If a tree doesn’t need all of the nutrients, the fungi will hold onto them and may give them to that tree at a later date—a sort of teamwork perhaps. It is to this idea that I will provide a bit of insight into the building of <em>Forestrial Brain</em>, an enormous drawing installation that densely networked its way across the walls during the summer months at Open Space in 2017.</p>

<p>The budding of Jim Holyoak and Matt Shane’s collaborative practice began eighteen projects earlier in their shared basement suite in Victoria, BC while attending the University of Victoria in Visual Arts. During these formative years, the walls of their shared living space became an assemblage for creation and drawing, authenticating their day to day with visual illuminations, even accommodating the addition of cooking splatters on the walls. A live/work studio, but not in the sense of carving out designated studio space in the home, rather a space of constant flux, development, reworking, and living inside, and alongside their creative work. This process-based methodology and collaborative practice marked a pivotal juncture that has continually corroborated their practice(s).</p>

<p><em>Forestrial Brain</em> began as projects often do with endless considerations and possibilities. A plenary residency along the West Coast Trail emerged as the outset that would render the groundwork and research for the drawings at Open Space. The West Coast Trail, located along the west coast of southern Vancouver Island, is a rugged and arduous 75km trek of trodden paths amid dense forest and enormous boulders. Embarking on this hike was like the fungi/tree exchange for the artists, to learn and immerse in the seen and unseen causeways and congruence between flora and fauna, and to be integrated into this immensity for eight grueling days.</p>

<p>Upon returning to Open Space, the artists had made a surplus of sketches and had taken photographs and video footage (many of which have been shared in this publication) to be used as support for their work. Papered walls from floor to ceiling, scaffolding, and many nocturnal nights, <em>Forestrial Brain</em> became an active studio space and a complex organism of their experience on the trail. An apposition of what is inside and what is outside of the body and brain, inside the urban sprawl, and outside of humanized space. The ubiquitous brain grew each day at Open Space, or more accurately, each night—the artists worked many evenings until the sun would break and the seagulls clocked in with their routine morning calls.</p>

<p>The installation was rendered in ink and brushed on with various sized brooms and paintbrushes, rags, and blown on with straws. In concord of each other, Jim and Matt’s work overlapped and formed segues of amorphous and identifiable space—a space notably characteristic of the geography found on the West Coast Trail, while completely intertwined with imaginative tangents and crosshatched with strains of the artists’ previous collaborative projects. After all a brain embellishes, diminishes, recreates, interprets, imagines, grasps, obscures, connects, complicates, simplifies, nuances, entangles, unravels, separates, merges, centres and decentres, among many other things, the way we perceive what is around us.</p>

<p>While the installation developed over six weeks, never was the horizon line attainable; the point of perspective impartial. With no ideal viewing position, the viewer’s body was implicated into the space—surrounded and immersed, and imbued into the environment to remind us that we exist within a dynamic network.</p>
