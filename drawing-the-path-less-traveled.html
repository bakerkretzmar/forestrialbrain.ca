<h3>Drawing the Path Less Traveled</h3>
<p class="byline">Tracy Valcourt</p>
<p class="quote">The unity of the All in the One is “a most solid foundation for the truths and secrets of nature. For you must know that it is by one and the same ladder that nature descends to the production of things and the intellect ascends to the knowledge of them; and that the one and the other proceeds from unity and returns to unity, passing through the multitude of things in the middle.”</p>
<p class="credit">Giordano Bruno, quoted in <em>The Art of Memory</em><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>On the top shelf of my library, side by side, are three epics: <em>Don Quixote</em>, <em>The Divine Comedy</em>, and <em>The Odyssey</em>. Their arrangement, which at the moment of my recent approach seemed serendipitous, was no doubt the product of some categorical logic at a moment now beyond my recollection. Awareness of the accidental juxtaposed with the contrived is not misplaced when thinking about the places of Jim Holyoak and Matt Shane—dark dream worlds made of elements real, imagined, and remembered. Like the celebrated Italianate landscapes of the Dutch seventeenth century, they are partly truthful records of place, composed as they are of what is and what could be. The mythical and imaginary qualities carried within these landscapes make them extensions of an early Northern European tradition, aligning them with those of Patinir; while their gorgeous cataloguing of growth and decay recalls Bruegel and Rubens. In terms of literary antecedents (as the mechanics of their pictorial work is almost always narratival), Holyoak and Shane’s enduring interrogation of nature’s complex network aligns their multi-chaptered works with the epic tradition—one of those giant books, when good, you never want to end. Historically anchored in a past beyond the scope of general comprehension, their often-cautionary tales are forged in the line and shadow of a present continuous tense that urges a look forward while still encouraging the occasional nervous backward glance.</p>
<p>In <em>Forestrial Brain</em>, dark shadowy ink wash and elegant line render a coastal old growth in all its baroque fecundity, where roots and limbs form entanglements that both choke and embrace. Always attentive to the interconnectedness of things, Holyoak and Shane’s ecosystems of the exterior world bear uncanny resemblance to biological interiors—the root systems are arterial; the tree crowns, synaptic. In one section of this floor-to-ceiling drawing, a pile of worn ropes spill out from under the weather-worn ruins of a makeshift structure. With their fatigue and fray delicately depicted in a spectrum of gray-black ink, these coils resemble a mass of intestines evacuated, we can only imagine, from the belly of some deep-sea monster washed ashore. Elsewhere, a cleaved nurse stump exposes the elongated honeycomb of its structure to reveal the same sacred geometry that forms the matrix of our own tissue. Throughout the lush revolt of cedar and fern, ladders and bridges make for the only straight lines among the abundance of curve and twist. Aside from a curious long-nosed fellow sitting fireside, and his tent, these structures are the only human evidence, imposing (as man likes to do) a linear perspective on natural disorder, which offers an intriguing yet trepidatious invitation to follow a path through the unknown woods.</p>
<p>Thinking about the moody atmosphere of <em>Forestrial Brain</em>, I am first called to Dante, but find myself reaching as well for Cervantes and Homer, a little coincidentally (but not haphazardly), as an association is easily formed between these literary and pictorial works in their celebration of the “journey.” In a more general sense, we can find other bonds between these historical and contemporary masters: Holyoak’s quixotic relationship with the imaginary; Shane’s commitment to structure of a Dantean proportion; and the ability of both artists to quite successfully confuse the quest for the homecoming, perhaps if only to admire the same landscape from two different vantage points. Movement and travel (or the journey) is a guiding principle for Jim Holyoak and Matt Shane, who have lived, worked, and exhibited internationally. This constant motion (which in the case of these artists is often tandem) could be motivated by what Rebecca Solnit calls a “loyalty to ideas,” the immateriality of which she feels inclines thinkers to a more nomadic lifestyle than “those whose loyalty is tied to people and locale.”<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>“Journey” in both its manifestations as verb and noun is rooted in action; it is a compound concept that requires territory and a body to move through it. In creating detailed large-scale landscapes generally devoid of human staffage (though not of human trace), Holyoak and Shane encourage the viewer to become the pilgrim of his or her own path. As such, they hasten us towards metamorphosis—the governing principle of their work and of nature as well, which illustrates the fallacy of the static among the living. Transformed into more active agents, we (once-were viewers, now made subjects) have extended the boundaries of the environment so that we now find ourselves within, rather than in front of this delicately rendered grayscale forest in which vegetation both drapes from above and reaches from below. Through a vibrant metempsychosis between hand and pencil that carries the diffused pulse of its makers and disturbs the scale of certain creatures, reign by ratio is given to royalty as unlikely as the banana slug. Invited into its kingdom, we loyal subjects expand its ink-wash world into the third dimension.</p>
<p>Despite this offer of transformation, there would be little blame if we were to pause at the mouth of the path, in sublime arrest that today becomes a thing more difficult to name, living as we are in some gob-smacked trance in witness to a world being broken to pieces. It is here, at the hesitant entrance, the deliberate beginning, that I am made to think of Dante and the opening lines of <em>Inferno</em>: “When I had journeyed half of our life’s way, I found myself within a shadowed forest, for I had lost the path that does not stray.” Here Dante is on the edge of a world structured of its own accord; a place of foreboding in its uncertainty, where, much as in life, the pace of movement will be dictated by the obstacles encountered, and the grace of stride in our means of navigating the troubled topographies.</p>
<p>Entrance to the woods, even in its most practical and unliterary manifestation, is an act that involves a conscious recognition of trespass from one territory into another—and like any entrance it is motivated by a curiosity often laced with fear and/or delight. In the first line of <em>Inferno</em>, literary theorist Leo Spitzer remarks on Dante’s use of the object pronoun “our” (“our life’s way”), which he feels carries within it the “possessive of human solidarity.”<sup>3</sup> There is something of this universal pronoun in the works, collective or solo, by Holyoak and Shane, which constantly recognizes humans as a community of makers and destroyers, but beings nonetheless endowed with agency in an increasingly fragile world. Conscious that their fabricated worlds are but microcosms within the macro of space and time, these artists do not here (nor elsewhere) offer a pastoral oasis for escape, but rather confront us with a speculative pictorial narrative and in doing so ask us to choose a cardinal direction of our own potential. Illustrating the delicate borderline that exists between the real and the remembered (what is and what once was), <em>Forestrial Brain</em> is a place that suggests actual biomass. Heavy and “real,” we can virtually smell the salt and cedar of the western coastline and feel the wetness of leaves as they brush our skin in passing, and yet the entire structure offers an ethereal taunt as though made of vapour, dispersed but with the touch of a finger.</p>

She is currently pursuing her PhD (Humanities) through the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Society and Culture at Concordia University. Her research examines the aerial perspective as the dominant visual paradigm in terms of understanding landscape. With a particular interest in photos captured by drones and satellites, her study examines ocular and philosophical shifts in viewing landscape as it undergoes accelerated degradation in the Anthropocene.
