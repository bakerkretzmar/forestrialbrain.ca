<h3>The Brain of the Brain: Becoming Forestrial</h3>
<p class="byline">Jennifer Cane</p>
<p>In early July 2017, Matt Shane and Jim Holyoak started out on an eight-day hike following Vancouver Island’s West Coast Trail. With limited tools to record the journey: ink, pens, and paper, they anticipated an experience of immersion—absorbing the elements of the forest, becoming still within its furrows, with its plants and animals, and carrying back some of these moments. The resulting gallery installation is a recombination of encounters, memories, and imaginings retrieved from their time within the forestrial brain.</p>
<p>Even for the seasoned hiker, this one rates as “difficult”: seventy-five kilometres of arduous terrain that stretches out between Pachena Bay and Gordon River. Set within the traditional territories of the Pacheedaht, Ditidaht, and Huu-ay-aht First Nations, who have known these forests since time immemorial, the trail’s development by settlers dates back just a little more than one hundred years. Established in its present form as a lifesaving route for shipwrecked mariners on the stormy stretch of the coast that came to be known as the Graveyard of the Pacific, the forest continues to be stewarded by local First Nations who manage the West Coast Trail Guardians Program, tending sacred and sensitive areas of the land, meeting hikers, and sharing stories.</p>
<p>Early on in their trip, the artists spent time with researchers at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre, where they were given the opportunity to examine the worlds of microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton living in seawater. The multiple, quickly-beating hearts of a larval octopus no bigger than the head of a pin was one particularly arresting experience. The artists attribute their approach to scale, which was a mixture of macro- and micro-elements within scenic flora and fauna, to this early stage of the journey.<sup>1</sup> They became intent on including many of the near-invisible members of ecological communities: the drifting diatoms and spores, the tiny thread-like branches of mycelium, and other creeping microorganisms of the earth.</p>
<p>Understandings of the forest-as-entity were central to this project, leading the artists into a great deal of research on silviculture and the interconnected ecology of trees. Dubbed “the wood wide web” by German forester Peter Wohlleben in his popular book <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, a brain-like web of understanding deep in the roots of trees and the mycelium of soil allows the healthy to nurse their sick and dying, creates friends (and enemies) between species, and prompts new life to emerge from the dead.<sup>2</sup> Building upon the work of renowned scientist Suzanne Simard from the UBC Faculty of Forestry, Wohlleben and others see the forest as a brain that transmits signals through fungal connections, exchanging information about insects, drought, and other dangers.</p>
<p>The project as a whole exhibits a mingling of ecological and psychosocial concerns, and the forestrial brain happens to be an excellent environment in which to explore the human brain, a three-pound organ of infinite complexity. Matt and Jim, who have developed a close working relationship over a period of fifteen years, found themselves drawn to different parts of the journey, both visually and thematically: Matt focused more on the structural elements and architecture of the trail, its bridges, cable cars and elaborate boardwalks, while Jim looked closely at the creatures of the forest both real and imagined, the slugs, ravens, and ‘alien campers’ of the night. Both artists describe their time on the trail as one through two worlds—two brains producing distinct visions and perceptions of their shared journey.</p>
<p>The installation of Forestrial Brain bears a resemblance to a much earlier form of illusory experience. In 19th century Europe and in the US, throngs of people immersed themselves within the visual sensation of the panorama. These all-encompassing, meticulously-detailed landscapes, battles, and scenes of historical fantasy used curved edges to produce convincing spatial illusion. For a small entrance fee, the public engaged in a new form of escapism, which was known to induce dysphoria and even panic in some viewers. For these reasons, panoramic painting was met with opposition, especially from those attached to the Romantic notion of the sublime. The sublime, as defined by Edmund Burke in his 1757 treatise “A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful,” was an aesthetic experience evoking danger or terror. The notion of the sublime was set apart from the notion of beauty, and dominated representations of the landscape during the Romantic period, characterized by storms of epic proportions, vistas without end, and the infinite grandeur of nature contrasted with the finite power of the human psyche.</p>
<p>Those who opposed the panorama seem to have resisted it in large part due to its popularity. Illusion was seen as a cheap form of trickery, in contrast to the scenes of immediacy and dark emotion produced by Romantic artists such as J.M.W. Turner, who famously had himself lashed to the mast of a ship for several hours during a storm in order to accurately absorb its ferocity. The intense, awe-inspiring vistas of the Romantics set up a dramatic opposition: the individual against nature, echoing colonial expansion and industrialization. The panorama, I would argue, was a democratizing and embodied form of audience participation, as the group was physically enveloped within the scene, made dizzy from its unique form of spatial confusion. These old scenes, like the large-scale installation of Forestrial Brain, ask the viewer to enter and to stay, to delight in a sense of smallness, and to consider themselves not as foreigners, but as members of this world.</p>
<p>The durational and physical aspects of Forestrial Brain are twofold, mirroring each other—firstly through the exertion of the hike itself; hips grinding and calves aching from lugging gear, sleeping outside, and the sheer exhaustion of scaling steep and muddy terrain. The challenges of a trip like this can also be surprisingly emotional, with so much quiet, no distraction from a swirl of memories and thoughts, the pressure of keeping pace, and the prospect of being left behind. Rendering enormous scenes in the gallery presents yet another form of mental and physical toil; ascending ladders, perching for long periods at awkward angles, inhabiting the solitude of work day after day. The work here is illusionistic, but at a point it tips into the fantastic: craggy sea stack spires emerge from the mist, the body of an enormous stellar sea lion twisted with bull kelp, and a clearing in the forest closes into a trail that leads to a series of wooden ladders and platforms. These are quiet worlds for wandering minds.</p>
<p>Forestrial Brain demonstrates an impetus of engagement and generosity towards community concerns—of trees, of animals, and humans. Matt and Jim’s forest allows its audience to question its own scale, size, place, and purpose. This version of nature is not the “man versus nature” of colonialism or wilderness survivalism, but rather the “brain within brain” of what we can only hope will become a more interconnected future.</p>
