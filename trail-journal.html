<h3>Jim Holyoak’s Trail Journal</h3>
<p class="byline">Jim Holyoak</p>
<p><strong>12:48pm – June 28th 2017 – Victoria</strong></p>
<p>It’s almost psychedelically nostalgic being back here in Victoria with Matt, where we met in a Drawing 100 class, back in 1999. I’m living around the corner from our old place on Cedar Hill Road. Running a lot of errands. Our bags are HEAVY but we’re ready to be out there for a while.</p>

<p><strong>11pm – June 29th – Bamfield</strong></p>
<p>In a tent with Matt Shane writing by the light of a red headlamp. Matt is practicing the lost art of reading. There is a bulldog snoring in a tent across from us. Earlier, she charged at me aggressively, then decided she liked me, jumped up and slammed her mouth into mine, smacking my canine tooth with a kiss. Had to brush my teeth to get the taste out. In the bush behind us, a few frogs are croaking. In the distance to one direction is the engine of a truck. In the other direction is the deep, moaning hoot of a foghorn. Today, Matt and I drove from Victoria to Port Renfrew, stopping at Jordan River for a coffee.</p>
<p>From Port Renfrew we took a water-taxi along the entire coastline of the West Coast Trail from south to north, arriving in Bamfield. We saw lots of California and Steller Sea Lions hauled out together on the rocks. The Californians bark, but the Stellers roar. The two species co-exist in this area, Stellers migrating down from Alaska, and the Californians up from California.</p>

<p>I learned from our boat captain, who is a marine biologist, that over the course of evolution, the sea lions returned to the ocean later than seals did, so their hips are still free, and they’re more agile on land. They’re actually more closely related to bears than to lions. The Stellers are threatened now because of climate change and because their primary food sources are over-fished.</p>
<p>And now a gang of teenagers has pulled up, are banging on things and swearing at each other. I should try to sleep. Tomorrow to the marine station.</p>
<p>ps Change, flux, transformation. The metamorphic forest. Arboreal become bodily.</p>

<p><strong>10:55pm – June 30th – Bamfield</strong></p>
<p>Back in the tent. Matt with his head to the mesh-window, and me with my feet to it. Tomorrow we begin our trek, on what happens to be Canada’s 150th birthday. (Ugh.) We’ve found a more removed place to pitch our tent. Hopefully I can get a better night’s sleep.</p>
<p>This morning, Matt and I made some weak coffee, hiked up to the Marine Science Centre where we met a biologist named Phil who showed us around and took us out on a fieldtrip in Port Desiree. We measured the depth, temperature and light, and trawled for plankton. We brought our sample back to the lab to look at under microscopes and it was AMAZING. Crab larva, baby snails, diatoms, and best of all, a baby octopus. You could see its heart(s) beating.</p>

<p>Field Trip Notes: Bathymetry / Topography. Photic Zone (Zone of visible light. Where there is phytoplankton.) PORT/LEFT. Depth, temperature, density, visibility, salinity, pressure. Hemlock have the smallest cones (oh the shame.) Dinoflagellates (red tide.)</p>
<p>After, I gave Phil the Basking Shark painting I’ve carried from Montreal (what a journey that thing’s been on.)</p>
<p>Later, Matt and I re-packed our bags and tried to hike to Cape Beal. It was a good warm-up. Even with a mostly empty pack, my legs are tingling. Tapaltos Bay was bright and the surf was up. I made one sketch and then fell asleep on my face.</p>

<p>On the back of the drawing I’ve written: “I told myself to just hang on a little bit longer, while making the sketch. By the time I got to drawing the surf, I couldn’t take it, and lay down on my face, burying my feet in the sand, and was pummeled to sleep by the sound of the ocean. Matt woke me up later, when it was near dusk and time to hike back through the forest. We meant to go to Keeha Bay. We thought later that we accidentally went to Cape Beale, but it was Tapaltos Bay, not even half-way there.”</p>
<p>Matt woke me up at 7pm, and we hiked back just before dusk.</p>
<p>Pretty tired now. There’s a zillion slugs climbing on our tent. Good night.</p>
<p>ps Stems drooling with the froth of spit-bugs, peppered with pine needles. Bugs fly into my eyes just to die.</p>

<p><strong>10:40pm – Michigan – Creek</strong></p>
<p>In a tent with brutally sore hip joints. Today was the easiest day of the hike. There is definitely too much weight in my pack. Probably too much food. Plus too many art supplies, etc. Matt and I took a taxi to Pacheena Bay. We slowed right down for a confused old mink who ran back and forth in front of our taxi-van for a minute or so, unable to decide on which side of the road to jump out of the way.</p>
<p>Matt and I chilled on the beach. I wrote while Matt drew. After our orientation, we set out. Pretty soon Matt passed me. Then everyone else passed me too. And then I walked alone the rest of the way, stopping to take notes and sketches and photos, and to rest my hips. (They definitely seem damaged…). The big, old cedars are so beautiful and grotesque and have a strong presence, like people. I wondered if they could tell I was looking at them. I heard a rustling in the bushes and saw a bear cub scrambling down a tree, butt first. She looked back at me, which made me a little nervous because the bush around me was too dense to see into, and I didn’t know where her mom might be.</p>
<p>Later I found a lookout point atop a huge cliff. Below was the swirling, clashing ocean, and on rocks over the chasm was a colony of sleeping sea lions jostling, barking and roaring.</p>
<p>Back on the path, I made videos of mating millipedes and a passing banana slug. By the time I got to camp, it was getting dark already, and Matt had been waiting two hours. I ate a bunch, pitched the tent, did some stretching, stashed the food in a bear-box, and I’m gonna sleep now. Good night.</p>

<p><strong>10:01 – July 2nd – Klanawa River</strong></p>
<p>Sitting with a fire between my feet. It’s finally getting dark. There’s almost no one else around. Instead of Tsusiat Falls, we’re here. A campsite in the woods. It is awesome. I am so tired. Actually, I can barely keep my eyes open.</p>
<p>By the time we got out of the tent this morning, around 8am, almost everyone else was gone. Most of today was a beach walk in the mist. We chatted with a nice German couple. We found a stinky blob that was the remains of a grey whale.</p>
<p>We drew on the beach. I was tired. Could probably have used another cup of coffee.</p>

<p>I felt a little scatterbrained, clumsy, disorganized and nervous. Especially while climbing very steep ladders, and then walking along the edges of huge cliffs. Kept misplacing my camera. Hips in quite a lot of pain. Matt took the tent today. Both of our bags are obscenely heavy. But we’re supposed to be taking it slow.</p>
<p>My favourite part today was walking through a forest of old cedars. I wanted to draw them all, but then, we were worried about a beach crossing where we had to watch the time to avoid the incoming tide. It was fine. Did a bit of drawing but not so much. Good night.</p>

<p><strong>10:28pm – July 3rd – Tsusiat Falls</strong></p>
<p>Today was good. We only walked 5km. Along the way I stopped to draw from the top of a cliff, looking out toward a cave with churning ocean water, topped by wind-shaped pines, with bulbous protuberances, and tentacle-like roots.</p>
<p>The sun was blazing. In the distance, I could see Tsusiat Falls. At some point I accidentally kicked over my ink-container, and spilled pretty much the whole thing.</p>
<p>Oh well. Bag is a little lighter.</p>
<p>When I got down to the beach Matt was hanging out with a girl in a bikini named Christine. He’d been worried about me again because I took hours longer than him. But it was only 3pm. (We left camp at 11:30am.) The sun sets around 9pm. Christine’s friend had badly injured her knee. She had to be carried out yesterday by a team of Trail Guardians. Two of the Trail Guardians were there. I wanted to chat with them but felt shy and didn’t know where to begin.</p>
<p>Matt and I went swimming in the falls. It was so awesome. The water is around 7' deep. Perfect swimming hole. Not super cold. Especially on a hot day like today. Matt went swimming three times. And made quite a few sketches of the falls and other stuff. I haven’t been feeling as inspired as him.</p>
<p>I got a bit more sketching done tonight.</p>
<p>Some random guy walks by asking to see. “Nice hobby,” he says, and continues on.</p>

<p>Matt takes one look at a tangled braid of bull-kelp and states that he’s hungry for pasta.</p>
<p>I tried twice, turning my phone on to call home, cause home is where the heart is, but there’s no reception. As I walk, I try to think of interesting ideas for poems or stories. Not much flowing yet. Tomorrow we hike 17km, which will be the most in a day by far. Trying to eat lots of food to lighten my bag. Hips ain’t what they used to be. Goodnight.</p>
<p>ps A tangled path of wood. A burnt tongue for breakfast. Tangled ropes of giant sperm, slathered, flaccid, rotting on the beach, steaming in the sand, swarming with flies, encrusted in salt, melting, purple, brown, green, milky white.</p>

<p><strong>11:13pm – July 4th – Cribs Creek</strong></p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I’m the only one on the beach still awake. Funny how that happens, even out here. I don’t feel like getting up in the morning. I don’t want to go to sleep once it’s dark. I just went for a little wander.</p>
<p>My feet are still cold from the creek, where I was recording frogs until the MP3 recorder’s battery died. One of the frogs jumped directly into my shin.</p>
<p>I find I’m often burying my bare feet in the sand, and it’s warm underneath, still holding in the heat of the sun long after it’s set.</p>

<p class="caption">Photo by Jim Holyoak</p>

<p>The stars come out. The moon is almost full now. Following a satellite across the sky with my eyes. Laying on my back across driftwood, and stretching my hips. Tip my head to look back at the forest upside down, the sky like a pool below I could fall into, if gravity let go. The rows of trees are not a straight line, but arch around the edge of the sky.</p>
<p>I looked, and off in the distance there were fireworks erupting from the Olympic Peninsula. Spent a while making fun of American nationalism today with Matt Shane, as we trudged through the kelp and stones and sand and fog.</p>
<p>To tell you about today, waking up felt terrible. I’d slept with my head downhill, and just outside the mesh-window was a big fat mouse who was scurrying around my backpack. (There was nothing to eat in it—all our food is in a bear box every night.) A lot of tossing and turning. Having to pee but not having the morale to get up and go outside. Then I’d finally get up, go out and be dazzled by the night sky.</p>
<p>Woke up to an alarm that Matt set on my watch. Felt much better after a big mug of coffee.</p>
<p>We befriended a young, married couple from New Zealand—Zane and Charlotte. Matt and I hiked with them part of the way to Nitinat Narrows. I often dawdled behind to make drawings of monstrous stumps and to collect field-recordings of birdcalls.</p>

<p>At Nitinat Narrows, our ferryman was an Indigenous man named Perry, dressed very dapper—nice shoes, slacks, jacket, hat, sunglasses, and many necklaces. Zane asked him about his necklaces. He said they were made by his daughters. Zane asked how many daughters he had. Perry paused, seeming to count in his head, and then said, “Six.” Zane asked him if he had any sons. He paused, seeming to count in his head, and said, “Five. I used to have six, but one passed away last year.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” a couple of us said at the same time. We said nothing more for a while, then looking up at an eagle dropping out of the sky to catch a fish, Perry said, “I hope I come back as an eagle next time.”</p>
<p>On the other side of the narrows, I chatted with him for a while. I asked him how it was here in the winter. “Wet,” he said, “A lot of rain, and the level of the lake rises.” He showed me a photo on his phone that his daughter took of a cougar.</p>
<p>It was slack tide in the narrows, and sunny, so Matt and Zane and I went swimming. Felt amazing. Water was cold, clear and full of fish.</p>
<p>I spent money for my first time on the trek—bought a plain hot potato and a big coffee. And off we went. Matt and I went skinny dipping in a little river. We imagined bringing giant salamanders from east Asia and releasing them in BC. We took the forest path, past giant Sitka Spruce and Douglas Firs. (Saw a pair that were fused together—but of different species.) We took the beach and drew big rocks that looked like shoes or sailboats with trees on top.</p>

<p>Farther on, Matt and I discovered that we’d ignored the tide chart, and had arrived at a ledge over the water, shrinking with every lap of the rising tide. The 45° slope we needed to traverse had already been splashed. Wherever the stone was wet, it was slippery. We took off our bags, and passed them across, and just barely made it. Good thing we’d been traveling as a pair at that moment. Took a steep ladder back up into the forest. Tubes of branches open up to huge cliffs. (I can hear Steller sea lions growling right now, out in the direction of the surf.) I walked along most of the rest of the way. At one point, I stepped out onto a bridge, and below me was a mother river otter with two wrestling pups. They were too beautiful! The mum had human-like ears. I watched them for a while.</p>

<p>Came into camp and found Matt. He’d already had dinner and was drawing. I think he may be getting more drawing done than me. I am a bit slower. On a different time. Like now. He’s snoozing next to me, and I’m awake at 11:55pm, listening to the surf and the growling sea lions, with super cold toes, writing here…</p>
<p>ps If you believe in reincarnation, then other animals are potentially your family members, are potentially you last time, next time.</p>

<p><strong>1pm – July 5th – Walbran Creek</strong></p>
<p>Sitting on the beach in the fog. Passed <em>Chez Monique</em> where I saw a bunch of young hikers having lunch, which dissuaded me from going in, but made me a bit hungry, so I trudged onward a little farther to the driftwood, where I’m sitting and eating dried bread with the ‘Fatso’ peanut butter that my sister Jessica gave me for my birthday.</p>
<p>10:35pm</p>
<p>Everyone else is in their tents. We are at Walbran Creek, which is more like an emerald green swimming pool. Right now, I’m sitting by the fire, roasting my toes under a rising, filling moon, and the surf is crashing on the shore. Today was pretty hard—on the beach almost the entire way, trudging in the sand.</p>
<p>As with yesterday and tomorrow, I woke up exhausted. Matt had already eaten, drunk his coffee, brushed his teeth, and made some drawings. I’d under slept. I should be the night guard. A dense fog had gathered on the beach when I awoke. The morning sun shot crepuscular beams through the trees.</p>

<p>I went to get water from the creek, and on the way back there was a fog-bow—a very faint, soft-edged rainbow. Matt drew it, then left, and I trailed behind.</p>
<p>The sun was hot, even through the fog, which seemed to last hours before burning off. Felt like I was on an alien planet, exposed by the star. Which I guess is pretty much true. Can you imagine, being a new person here on Earth?</p>
<p>I drew some giant stone slugs with trees growing from their backs.</p>
<p>Found Matt by the Carmanah Lighthouse, sitting in the ferns, drawing an old tree.</p>
<p>Matt’s drawings have been coming out amazingly. He’s getting really good at observational sketches. Amazing control and fluency. His works are themselves—they don’t need to become anything else.</p>
<p>Mine are all weird and awkward and scrappy, more like notes.</p>
<p>For the longest time, I trudged alone on the sand getting burned. I’m definitely a tone darker now. I prefer walking in the forests to the beach. It’s cool and sweet smelling in there. And I love all the trees and vegetation.</p>

<p>Once I arrived at camp, I went swimming with Matt and Zane in the crystal-clear water of Walbran Creek. Cold and trembling after, I covered my bare legs with stones heated by the sun. Skipped dinner tonight. Tummy wasn’t up for it. Did a bunch more drawing with Matt. We’ve been collecting specimens, which we’ve been drawing around the fire.</p>
<p>ps I love walking around on driftwood. Exercises my sense of balance. Also, I love being out here, and I love being away from the stuff out there.</p>
<p>pps Is the sleeping giant blind? What do the blind see when they dream?</p>

<p><strong>10:23pm – July 6th – Walbran Creek</strong></p>
<p>I am by far the last person to leave camp. Have been alone here for an hour. I love taking my sweet-assed time. Get up late. Leave late. Arrive late. Stay up late. Still haven’t even finished packing. But that’s ok. This morning I went for a swim under the clouds. Finally, my body temperature is returning to normal.</p>
<p>Legs are pretty burnt from yesterday. Today is supposed to be tough too, but in the forest all day—the reverse of yesterday. Nine tough kilometers. Gonna stretch a little, pack my bag and go I guess.</p>
<p>Tummy feels a little weird. While brushing my teeth by the surf I suddenly barfed. A couple crows noticed right away. As I walked back up the shore, three of them came to scavenge the carrot chunks that came up from this morning’s instant quinoa pilaf. So interesting to watch these animals consume something that was just in the middle of my body (for at least 15 minutes). Extra cooked. I guess that could be what it’s like when we die.</p>
<p>11pm – Camper Bay</p>
<p>Again by the fire, alone after everyone else has gone to bed. I’ve added a few pieces of driftwood to the flame. But I shouldn’t stay up too late. Tomorrow at 6:45am the alarm on my watch will go off and then Matt and I can chat with the guys working on the trail around here.</p>
<p>So let me tell you about my day. It was a major hike, but totally different than yesterday. No beach walking at all—the whole time was in the forest. Lots of roots, some mud-pits, boardwalks through bogs, impressive old cedars, a crazy 1' wide suspension bridge across a ravine. Some very steep ladders. I made a lot of small drawings.</p>
<p>Collected some video of a banana slug turning. (Will be good on fast forward.) I was in a good mood. Lots of little chats with fellow hikers. Writing notes. Finding ideas.</p>
<p>Felt happy to eventually end up down here in Camper Bay, and to see Matt and our Kiwi pals, Zane and Charlotte, chilling by the fire.</p>

<p>Drew Matt as the Squirrel Wizard. Charlotte is the Wind Wizard, and Zane is the Fire Wizard. (He’s damn good at sparking a camp fire.)</p>
<p>ps Trees spilling over trees. Stone slug moves so slow they’ve grown a thicket on their back. Stone waves, wooden waterfalls, fossilized mud, kept forest, wet carpet of algae, elephantine upturned roots, woodland trolls and stone trolls, barnacles like molars, sand lice, banana slugs, stone nipples in the stream, sword ferns, skunk cabbage, the ocean an alien hydrosphere, the sky an abyss of stars, the flashing sun is a fire that all green things reach toward.</p>
<p>Tomorrow to Thrasher Cove.</p>

<p><strong>Just after midnight – July 7th – Thrasher Cove</strong></p>
<p>By far the last person out of camp this morning, and the last person to head in tonight. Spent the evening drawing under the rising moon, watching the tide come higher and higher, until it came all the way up and extinguished our bonfire in an enormous POOF of smoke and steam.</p>
<p>What a day. Way too much to recount, especially in my exhaustion now. (Matt drew me, enveloped by giant slugs, huge bags under my eyes.)</p>

<p class="caption">Drawings by Jim Holyoak and Matt Shane</p>

<p>Spent this morning making friends and chatting with the guys from the construction crew and Louis, the cook. Matt and I brought them some tobacco and dark chocolate. Matt drew a guy named Brian and gave him the portrait. I drew a portrait of Louis. James told me about Keeha Beach, which he says is a haunted place where ghosts can be seen.</p>
<p>Matt asked Louis about growing up at a residential school. He said it was horrible. Later, he told me with regret, that he never learned his native language. Louis spent about an hour chatting with me after everyone else left camp. What an amazing man. He met his wife when they were 13. I asked him if it was love at first sight.</p>
<p>“Yup,” he said.</p>
<p>But for the last 10 years, he’s been away 25 days out of every month, while working as a camp cook in the bush. He’s got arthritis in his hands from all the power tools, and will soon move back to the Ditidaht Village to be with his wife, and where he’s got a better paid cooking job. His wife needs him now, because she’s also got arthritis, but worse. Seems he’s looking forward to going back, although this also means the end of his traveling career.</p>
<p>He told me that he’s collected saplings from all over—wherever he’s worked—and has them growing all over his property—over 20 species. He said that a Japanese ship wrecked off the coast nearby. Over 30 people died. When the ship was salvaged they found a Japanese cedar was on board. He knows where it was planted and is growing now. He says it’s a really strange tree. He showed me how to approximate the age of a tree by counting down the significant branches—about one big branch per year of life.</p>
<p>I asked him about cougars and he said there was one attack he knew of on the trail. A 13-year-old was attacked while hiking, but survived. Luckily his/her parents were nearby and chased the cougar away. I brought up the idea of werewolves, and he told me another cougar story—about some hunters who were following a cougar on the edge of town, and saw it rustling in the bushes. They fired, but it was a teenage boy, shot right through the chest. He died in hospital shortly thereafter. A terrible accident.</p>
<p>When I was leaving camp, I stopped by to shake hands with Louis, and he asked for my email. He said he likes the Habs, and wanted a hat. I hope he’ll write me. I would love to send him a legit Habs hat from Montréal. And if I ever get back on the trail, I want to visit the Ditidaht Village and visit him again, and see those trees he’s growing.</p>
<p>Another thing I should write, something important, is that while talking with James, Christianity somehow came up, and I mentioned that I didn’t feel at home in churches anymore.</p>
<p>James said simply, “Then you’re not a Christian.”</p>
<p>I looked at the trees above us and said, “I feel like I’m in a much more holy place out here.”</p>
<p>James looked at me, as if to say, “Of course.”</p>
<p>I walked the forest route all the way from Camper Bay to Thrasher Cove, skipping the beach with giant boulders and surge channels, instead for a stretch of the trail I’d never walked before. Feels good to walk the broken boardwalks and root-systems, quickly, instinctively reading the terrain. (It reminds me of snowboarding.)</p>

<p>I didn’t encounter any trekkers—just giant, creaking cedars, silent slugs, gorgeously singing birds, and then three of the guys from the construction crew. They’d just marched all the way to Gordon River to fill their backpacks with cans of pop, and were on their way back to Camper Bay. I chatted with them a while.</p>
<p>One guy told me about how he’d been out to Kelowna when he was younger, on a hockey trip. It was a Christian-organized event, “but I’m not a Christian,” he said, “and so when everyone went to church, I went for a walk. I found a thing making a weird sound, and I didn’t know what it was, so I picked it up by its tail. It was a baby rattle snake.”</p>
<p>The rest of way was a gorgeous hike through the forest, sheltered from the sun by those giant trees. The forest smelled sweet. I watched and listened to a Stellar Jay imitate a hawk, an eagle, and the sound of a creaky tree. I collected audio samples and sketches, and on the last day, I felt my anxious mind finally release, become receptive, and ideas came flooding into me.</p>
<p>What else? Along a side-path, near the coast, hanging over the shelves of rock and the pounding ocean far below, I could feel my life in my hands, my heart beating in my chest.</p>

<p><strong>July 8th – Victoria</strong></p>
<p>Made it back. So tired. Last night I was up late, alone on the beach, stretching out my hips while everyone else slept, writing postcards. A mink scampered past me, probably chasing mice around the tents. I slept poorly. Matt told me to get up at 7:30am. By the time I emerged, everyone else had been up for hours. I was, of course, the last person to leave Thrasher Cove. Before starting up the ladders, I waded into the ocean, knee deep, took a look around and said to myself, “You don’t have to.” So I turned and took a few steps back toward shore before saying to myself, “Yes you do.” So I turned around again, and dove into the cove, along with a school of minnows, like marine tadpoles. I only swam a few minutes, but long enough to adapt to the cold, and came out refreshed. I wish that I lived by the ocean all the time. I swear I’d live longer, be healthier, more relaxed and clear headed. (But is life just for living as long and healthy as possible? What about beating the hell out of yourself, surviving through all the grueling, toxic, exhausting hardships you could lust for?)</p>
<p>While climbing the ladders, I passed a German couple, huffing and puffing. “We’re not getting younger,” the guy said. True that. I am pleased to see that I’m still strong enough to hike this path, and in fact, I’m a little more fit now than I was at the beginning, but those thousands of skateboarding impacts have taken a toll. I have to take frequent breaks. My hips can just barely take it. But I still have plenty of energy. What will I use it for?</p>
<p>Eventually I caught up with Matt Shane in the mist, drawing the derelict donkey.</p>

<p>I walked the rest of the trail with him, killing my second camera battery and drawing monstrous trees. Matt and I chatted. He says I have to stop feeling dissatisfied with my days by needing to do everything, failing to do the impossible, and so never relaxing, but how do I let go? How do I “just relax”?</p>

<p>We arrived at the last ladder just as the ferryman was pulling up on shore to pick up our fellow hikers, the Kiwis and Calgarians and Winnipeggers. That last ladder was 90° and long. With every rung, I felt my still-heavy pack pulling back, reminding me: one hand at a time.</p>
<p>Zane and Charlotte went for veggie burgers with us in Port Alberni. Then we dropped them off crossroad to Nanaimo, where they went off hitchhiking into the future.</p>
<p>Matt and I drove back to Victoria, fully pummeled. I unpacked. Took a hot shower. Walked down Cedar Hill Road, my old street. Called home, and heard that central BC is in the midst of an inferno. Some of the areas on fire are the same places that were in a state of emergency from flooding less than a month ago.</p>
<p>Matt picked me up at Thrifty Foods, and we drove to the Oak Bay Pool. Mostly chilled in the hot tub, which stung my sun-burnt legs. Swam a few lazy lengths under the ceiling lights and plastic palm trees. Crazy to think I’d been in Thrasher Cove, just this morning.</p>

<p>Love Jim</p>
