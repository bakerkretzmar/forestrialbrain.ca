<h3>The Psychogeography of Forestrial Brain: An annotated interview with Jim Holyoak and Matt Shane</h3>
<p class="byline">Greta Hamilton</p>
<p><strong>[on language, thought, community]</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> <em>Forestrial</em> is kind of a made up word, coming from some ideas in a few books I’ve been reading. One of the books is <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em> by Peter Wohlleben, and that's about the ways that trees act as communities. They can transfer nutrients to each other through underground mycorrhizal networks. They can also warn each other about predators that are attacking and send signals to each other about the changing environment.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> I think the other aspect of the <em>Forestrial Brain</em> is, can a tree have awareness? Obviously a plant doesn’t have a nervous system, but plants do grow towards light. [They] have senses of sound and smell and touch, and can create sound and scents, so there is an exchange of information. Plants are perceiving things. The question isn’t if trees think like we do, the question is, what is thought? People usually think of thought in a verbal sense, often presuming animals that don’t speak are somehow less intelligent. But of course there’s other kinds of thinking that are non-verbal. When it comes to the non human, it’s hard for us to imagine what that is. What would it be like to be a tree? Can they think? Can they perceive? Do they have a degree of awareness? What is that awareness like? Is it a consciousness? An unconsciousness? How would that change if [a tree] can’t walk around but lives to be 2000 years old. In the forest itself, the tree is interesting because it’s part landscape and partly a figure in the landscape. As a grouping, [trees] become a community but also a habitat for creatures that certainly do have sensations.</p>

<p><strong>[on collaboration, trees, mirrors]</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> We saw a lot of nurse stumps—trees that were cut down a long time ago, and new trees are growing out of the old trees. The line between life and death in the forest is, in a way, unclear. A dead animal becomes an active, life-engendering site, home to scavengers, fungus and mega-cities of micro-organisms. As artists in the gallery, we work together by exchanging ideas, encouragement, and physical marks, bouncing back and forth in a kind of ongoing conversation. We’re creating a visual ecosystem. We were inspired by what we saw around us, and the incredible diversity of life in the forest. Hopefully our drawing transmits some of the same wonder we felt on the trail.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> I think in a way the nurse log metaphor works, in the sense that we do share thoughts that grow. And our thoughts would be different if we did this by ourselves. We were often by ourselves, but there were times [on the trail] we were glad we were together. In an area where the tide was coming up a little faster than we thought, and we had to heave our bags from one to another across slippery rocks, getting splashed by the incoming surf, when we really only had minutes to either cross or wait for the tide to go out again.</p>
<p class="quote">“Underground there is this other world, a world of infinite biological pathways that connect trees and allow them to communicate, and allow the forest to behave as though it’s a single organism. It might remind you of a kind of intelligence… Forests aren’t simply collections of trees, they’re complex systems of hubs and networks that overlap and connect to communicate, and provide avenues for feedback and adaptation. This makes the forest resilient.”</p>

<p><strong>[on memory, perception, reality]</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> I think for both of us, Coastal BC forests have figured heavily in our memory, and that represents a kind of home for us. I find for myself, when I’m not sure what to draw, I dip into this memory bank, and that’s what’s there; big trees, mountains, rocks around the beaches, salal, moss, mushrooms, foliage, stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> If somebody asks me where I’m from, and I close my eyes, I see pine trees in the rain, and mist. This was my third time hiking the West Coast Trail, but my first time hiking the trail with the specific purpose of drawing everything. Was there a process of clearing my memory? Well, my memory is terrible. I can remember a place, a landmark, but have very poor sense of direction. In terms of our practice as mapping, I think, in the sense that mapping is connected to memory, yes, but in the sense that mapping is also about showing your way, my [drawings] don’t do that. My trail is lost.</p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> Our perceptions of what is real on the trail and what’s real [in the gallery] is colored by our past experiences. It’s hard to say where the line between reality and fantasy is. We try to emphasize the shifting nature of reality. The landscape that we’re doing is a metamorphic one—we’ll have areas where what looks like a tree is becoming liquid or floating into the atmosphere. All of these things are in flux, and that’s what we’re hoping to express.</p>

<p><strong>[on material, myth]</strong></p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> The reactions of ink and water and brushes and brooms—using these dry brooms to sweep into the walls is great for creating a barky texture, and spritzing ink malts in a way that’s very much like Spanish Moss. Our materials lend themselves to these kinds of subjects. In the case here, all of the drawings we’ve begun on the wall started with a photographic reference or a sketch we made on the trail. So we’ve sketched those out [on the walls], then in between we have to make connections, and in a way this metamorphosis is descriptive of how things work outside. The fog comes in, and things made of stone materialize, then disappear back into the fog, or root systems pour down the trail that can look like tentacles and arms and fingers and roots. I’ve seen branches that look exactly like a human thumb. While we were working in Norway, I got really interested in trolls. You can see old branches that seem to have faces, and mountainsides that almost have ears eyes nose and mouth—by chance of course. A few hundred years ago, the best explanation was that, there are monsters out there that transform—the sunlight shines on them and turns them to stone, night falls and these things come back to life. I think that this is kind of metaphorical for some things in reality. The giant cedar trees that grow here are very old, and every time there’s a drought, they grow a new head. So they have a candelabra of branches on the top, trolls also do this, grow new body parts. Monsters often have too much of something or not enough, and this is what creates the sense of the grotesque. This we see all the time in the forest and on the beach, where the roots and the kelp looked so much like giant sperms, or like guts that spilled out—all these things that refer to the body or viscera.</p>
<p class="quote">“Landscapes are culture before they are nature; constructs of the imagination projected onto the wood and water and rock… But it should also be acknowledged, that once a certain idea of landscape, a myth or vision, establishes itself in an actual place, it has a peculiar way of muddling categories, of making metaphors more real than their referents, of becoming, in fact, part of the scene.”</p>

<p><strong>[on Western landscapes, Chinese ink painting, focal points]</strong></p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> In Southern China we met a master nightscape ink painter. For Matt and I both, Chinese landscape painting has been at least as inspirational as Western landscape painting. I think growing up in coastal BC, that’s not a surprise. Italian linear drawing or painting didn’t make much sense to me [in this place.] There’s a lot less straight lines in BC, lots of fog, lots of rain, craggy rocks, strange trees, a blurry line between the sky and the ocean. Atmospheric perspective [exists here] so I related quickly to the Chinese perspective.</p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> I think we try to mix up our influences. I’m more influenced by Hudson River School, Western landscape, the Romantics, but also Chinese ink painting. I think there’s ways we weave them together. Navigation is an inherent part of all landscapes. As a viewer you automatically think about how you would travel through the space. When we think of a successful landscape, it often means there’s a clear trail for us to walk along. In this installation, it’s important for us to create navigational possibilities, but also to confuse them, or to block entrance. It’s not a linear navigation, and that’s partly emphasized by the shape of the ‘canvas’ that surrounds the viewer and doesn’t privilege one perspective over another.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> We’re both interested in the concept of the long zoom, a satellite’s point of view zooming in to the microscopic. This happens a bit in a drawing installation like this, which is different than looking at a conventional painting. This drawing looks completely different up close than far away, you can’t see it all in a glance, and it takes time if you really want to see everything.</p>
<p class="quote">“Renaissance European perspective has a vanishing point, [that] does not exist in Japanese and Chinese painting. And a view from sitting still, from a stationary point, is not the way you usually see landscape; you are always moving through it. If you put a vanishing point anywhere it means you’ve stopped. In a way, you’re hardly there. […] The scroll is a different sort of picture. You don’t entirely unravel a scroll; you turn it continually. So it doesn’t really have edges in a normal sense. The bottom is you, perhaps, and the top is the sky… Instead of mentally travelling into the picture, you travel up it; over passes, under beetling crags. Generally there are signs of humanity within the picture—a party of travelers, a hermit meditating in a pavilion, a temple built improbably on a jagged outcrop—though they are tiny in comparison with the majesty of the terrain. On horizontal scrolls one travels through time as one unrolls the picture, never seeing the entire image all at once.”</p>

<p><strong>[on imagined environments, value, position]</strong></p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> I often speak about this meeting of the real with the unreal, the imaginary and the observed, and the tension between them. I think that it’s a very tricky thing to qualify, because I’m not trying to give an answer about this phenomena, but I’m trying to describe this [relationship.] It becomes a mixture of philosophy, science and spirituality. Trying to figure out what it is to look at reality, and balance skepticism with an awareness and open mind that, after everything we know, life is still very mysterious. So there’s a certain humility that goes with this.</p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> We’re not really providing any answers, we’re not coming up with any grand conclusions about life, death, ecology, the environment. In a way, we’re wanderers—curious people thinking about all this stuff. We’re creating an environment where these thoughts can happen.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> On the other hand, I do think we’re making a point. Looking at a forest simply as resources doesn’t lend itself to also asking “What is it like to be a tree?” Well, what is it like to be called a resource? There’s an ideology to the words we use, and I think we’re trying to complicate that. By asking these questions, we’re looking at [the environment] beyond human scale, concern, and time.</p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> I guess it has to do with value too, and how we place value on the elements around us. Is it just what brings in more capital, or is there a value beyond that? If you see a tree as having a kind of consciousness, or a right to live its own life, it opens up a new forum where humans aren’t at the top of a hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> I think it’s highly environmental. The [gallery] itself is an interior environment inhabited by humans. It’s fair to describe us as environmentalists, in that we’re thinking about place, but we’re thinking about it beyond people, and thinking about value in terms of non-human or more-than-human beings. And we wonder how to take care of these places.</p>
<p class="quote">“A tree in the forest, surrounded by other trees, aesthetically beautiful in its vertical defiance of gravity. It is assigned a monetary value. A tree cut, laid horizontal, becomes a log. As it moves incrementally away from its point of origin, carried by brute force, it increases in value all the more. A tree cannot simply exist in the forest: once singled out for consumption, it must now bear the immense symbolic and physical wealth it represents in terms of natural reproduction, industrial recomposition, material fragmentation or destruction, associated industrial applications such as tourism, and that catch-all, metonymized by the tree itself: the environment.”</p>

<p><strong>[on violence, excess, place]</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> I think when we see a clearcut forest we have a response that’s highly emotional, it’s witnessing the overwhelming scale of destruction. Forests take hundreds of years to grow, and when you level them completely in this way that’s so reckless and immediate, it feels viscerally wrong. It’s beyond what we need, it’s an excess, and it’s about maintaining a level of wealth but it’s not necessary to log in that way. So that does affect us and we talk about it, but I don’t know if it will end up on the walls here.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> I’m hoping that the message isn’t overtly about violence, but violence is a part of things that have sensations. It’s not controversial to think that if you’ve shot a deer, you’ve killed it, or if you kick a dog, you’ve injured it. But if you cut down a forest, can you hurt a place? Can a setting be injured? I think there’s a way to steer this conversation toward the future, or to the deeper past. Some of our most inspiring times on the trail were talking with the First Nations people who live there, and the anecdotes they shared. We met a ferryman from the Ditidaht First Nation, who described the local bald eagles as his family members, and expressed hope to come back as an eagle someday. What would change if more people viewed non-human animals as family, as our parents, as our children? I met another Ditidaht man who told me about collecting saplings from all the job sites where he’s worked on Vancouver Island. He’s brought these baby trees home and planted them all over his property. Those trees, in all likelihood, will still be growing there, hundreds of years from now. Matt and I were only travelers, but these men have lived in this rainforest by the ocean for their entire lives, and their ancestors have lived there for at least 5,000 years. It seems to me that people put special care into protecting places they view as home; when they view their home within a deeper sense of time; when those people and creatures with whom we co-exist are considered part of our family, rather than othered from us.</p>

<p>“If psychogeogaphy is to be understood in literal terms as the point where psychology and geography intersect, then one of its further characteristics may be identified in the search for new ways of apprehending our urban environment. Psychogeography seeks to overcome the processes of ‘banalisation’ by which the everyday experience of our surrounding becomes one of drab monotony. … This entire project is then further coloured by an engagement with the occult and is one that is as preoccupied with excavating the past as it is with recording the present.” Merlin Coverley, “Introduction,” in <em>Psychogeography (pocket essentials)</em>, OldCastle Books, 2012 (3).</p>

<p>“Phenomenology believes that analyzing daily human behavior can provide one with a greater understanding of nature. Persons should be explored. This is because persons can be understood through the unique ways they reflect the society they live in. Phenomenologists prefer to gather ‘capta,’ or conscious experience, rather than traditional data.” Mark P Orbe, “Phenomenology,” in S. Littlejohn & K. Foss (Eds.), <em>Encyclopedia of communication theory</em>, SAGE Publications, Inc., 2009 (750-752).</p>

<p>“Our challenge is to stop thinking of such things according to a set of bipolar moral scales in which the human and the nonhuman, the unnatural and the natural, the fallen and the unfallen, serve as our conceptual map for understanding and valuing the world. Instead, we need to embrace the full continuum of a natural landscape that is also cultural, in which the city, the suburb, the pastoral, and the wild each has its proper place, which we permit ourselves to celebrate without needlessly denigrating the others. We need to honor the Other within and the Other next door as much as we do the exotic Other that lives far away—a lesson that applies as much to people as it does to (other) natural things.” William Cronon, <em><a href="http://www.williamcronon.net/writing/Cronon_Trouble_with_Wilderness_1995.pdf" target="_blank">The Trouble with Wilderness</a></em>, 1995.</p>
