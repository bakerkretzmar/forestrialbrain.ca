We are grateful for support from Island Blue, Pacific Rim National Park Reserve (Parks Canada), Swan Lake Christmas Hill Nature Sanctuary, and Phillips Brewery for contributing to the success of Forestrial Brain. Thank you to Elizabeth Murphy for assisting with the paper installation, Matt McCoy and Robert Beneroya for bartending at the finissage (closing reception), Patti Page for her assistance at the finissage, James Letkeman for capturing the energy and joy of the evening, Hush Hush Noise (Lily Fawn and Eric Hogg) and Holy Oak (Neil Holyoak, Jessica Ip Hoi Wan, and Devon Beggs) for their musical genius at the finissage, and Jesse Campbell for assisting with the strike of the exhibition. Finally, thank you to Open Space staff, particularly Helen Marzolf, Kegan McFadden, Regan Shrumm, Megan Quigley, Miles Giesbrecht, Greta Hamilton, Ben Wagg, Kara Stanton, and Sandra Hudson, who were indispensable to this project.</p>
<p>Jim Holyoak and Matt Shane would also like to thank: their dear friends in Victoria, the new friends they made at Open Space, the West Coast Trail Guardians for sharing their stories on the shore of Camper Bay, Mike McLean for documenting <em>Forestrial Brain</em> (and for teaching them about keeping their ‘table stable’), Jennifer Cane and Tracy Valcourt for their contributing insights and compelling essays, Phil Lavoie at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre for taking them trawling for plankton and showing them a baby octopus under the microscope, Jacob Baker-Kretzmar for his stellar design of this web-catalogue, and professor Lynda Gammon for encouraging their first collaborative projects while students of hers at the University of Victoria. The artists also wish to express their hearty thanks to Breanna Fabbro, for allowing her own brain to be temporarily woven into the <em>Forestrial Brain</em>. Her ideas, energy and spirited efforts in seeing things through were vital to the successful completion of this project, and are sincerely appreciated.</p>
